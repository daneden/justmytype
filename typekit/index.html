			<h1>Flesh it out</h1>
			<p>Freight Sans Black is <strong>strong</strong> &mdash; make a statement. Tisa is more delicate; but it still packs a punch. Get with the Times, New Roman. Did you hear about the fight between the sans-serifs? The violence was Grotesk, but Akzidenz happen.</p>

			<h1>Serious fun.</h1>
			<p>It started with a local hot-dog eating contest. Lou Verbain took first place, and moved on to the provincials, where he placed second. But the first-place contestant bowed out when his stomach ruptured, and Lou was on to the nationals. At internationals he placed a distant third to a whip-thin Japanese girl.</p>
			<p>Lou wasn't about to take that lying down, so he went into hard-core training. He ate all the hot dogs in town, then in the province, and eventually he caused a continent-wide shortage in meat-ish products. He moved on. Hamburgers, pies, cookies, anything he could stuff down his gullet. He grew and grew, too, expanding like a weed, like a balloon. It was surreal.</p>
			<p>The day he started eating cars was probably the point of no return. He started small, with a rusted-out Datsun, but by week's end he was devouring Hummers and limos. At some point hydrogen fusion started up in his stomach, but he didn't notice.</p>
			<p>Long story short, now he's a black hole, Verbain X-1, and the Universe is slowly falling into him.</p>​
